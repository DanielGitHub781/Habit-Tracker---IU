## Habit Tracker

Welcome to my habit tracker.

This *habit tracker* is a project I have done as a student for the IU International University of Applied Sciences. Here you can create, delete, check and analyse your habits. One of the hardest things when trying to establish good habit is, is having enough motivation to keep going. Thats why the habit tracker has a system set in place with whom you can track how many times in a row you have completed the habit and how much money you have saved, when for example you want to stop smoking.
